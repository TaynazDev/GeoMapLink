# Satellite Image Setup

## Adding Your Satellite Image

1. Save your satellite image as `satellite.jpg` or `satellite.png` in the root directory
2. The image should be an equirectangular projection of Earth (like the Blue Marble image)
3. Recommended resolution: 5400x2700 or higher for best quality

The map will automatically use `./satellite.jpg` as the primary source, with a fallback to `./satellite.png`.
